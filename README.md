- ### to run this project:

## the technology that I used it in this project:
- I used `Laravel` as **server side** with `sqlite` database
- I used `InertiaJS` which allows me to create fully client-side rendered, single-page apps, without the complexity that comes with modern SPAs. It does this by leveraging existing server-side patterns that you already love.  
- I used `VueJS` as **client side** to make single Page Application
- I used `Tailwindcss` to make the UI more user-friendly and responsive to use it in any users screen size.

## the project features:
- build single page Application by using `VueJs` and `InertiaJS`
- connected it with `Laravel` as backend to manage users data.
- connected database `sqlite` with `Laravel` as server side.
- implement `Authentication` and `Authorization` in both **server and client** side.
- handle any  `unAuthentication` and `unAuthorization` request in both side.
- use `Tailwindcss` to style my web Pages and make it responsive.
